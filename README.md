# Alba Habla

_A fun little wrapper around your OS's speech synthesizer_

## Installation

Your system will need either `say` or [`espeak`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESpeakNG) installed (if you're on a Mac, `say` should already be installed).
```
$ gem install alba_habla
```

## Execution

```
$ alba_habla
What shall I say? 
```

**Note:** to exit the program, just say "bye".
